This is basically a project of website data scrapping.
Resources Used: 
Ruby
Nokogiri gems
CSS selectors

In the file Gettingteamall,
Firstly I have opened a page from codechef ranklist.
I searched through the page of getting my required data i.e the team handle and their universities and individual team members handle.
Then I have used CSS selectors to get those data and extract them and represent them in a proper format.

To run:
$ruby Gettingteamall.rb
